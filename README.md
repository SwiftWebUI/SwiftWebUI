At
[WWDC 2019](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc19/)
Apple announced 
[SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/).
A single "cross platform", "declarative" framework used to build 
tvOS, macOS, watchOS and iOS
UIs.
[SwiftWebUI](https://github.com/SwiftWebUI/SwiftWebUI)
is bringing that to the Web ‚úîÔ∏è

## SwiftWebUI

So what exactly is 
SwiftWebUI?
It allows you to write SwiftUI 
[Views](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view)
which display in a web browser:

```swift
import SwiftWebUI

struct MainPage: View {
  @State var counter = 0
  
  func countUp() { 
    counter += 1 
  }
  
  var body: some View {
    VStack {
      Text("ü•ëüçû #\(counter)")
        .padding(.all)
        .background(.green, cornerRadius: 12)
        .foregroundColor(.white)
        .onTapGesture(self.countUp)
    }
  }
}
```

Results in:

Unlike some other efforts this doesn't just render SwiftUI Views
as HTML. 
It also sets up a connection between the browser and the code hosted
in the Swift server, allowing for interaction - 
buttons, pickers, steppers, lists, navigation, you get it all!

In other words: 
[SwiftWebUI](https://github.com/SwiftWebUI/SwiftWebUI)
is an implementation of (many but not all parts of) the SwiftUI API for the browser.

## Requirements

Update 2019-07-08: There are three options to run SwiftWebUI:

### macOS Catalina

One can use a
[macOS Catalina](https://www.apple.com/macos/catalina-preview/)
installation to run SwiftWebUI.
Make sure that the Catalina version matches your Xcode 11 beta! (‚ÄúSwift ABI‚Äù ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)

Fortunately it is really easy to
[install Catalina on a separate APFS volume](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208891).
And an installation of
[Xcode 11](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
is required to get the new Swift 5.1 features SwiftUI makes heavy use of.
Got that? Very well!

> Why is Catalina required? SwiftUI makes use of new Swift 5.1 runtime features
> (e.g. opaque result types).
> Those features are not available in the Swift 5 runtime that ships with 
> Mojave.
> (another reason is the use of Combine which is only available in Catalina, 
> though that part could be fixed using
> [OpenCombine](https://github.com/broadwaylamb/OpenCombine))

### tuxOS

SwiftWebUI now runs on Linux using
[OpenCombine](https://github.com/broadwaylamb/OpenCombine) (also works without
that, but then some things don't work, e.g. `NavigationView`).

A [Swift 5.1 snapshot](https://swift.org/download/#snapshots) is required.
We also provide a Docker image containing a 5.1 snapshot over here:
[helje5/swift](https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/helje5/swift/tags).

### Mojave

The Xcode 11beta iOS 13 simulators do run on Mojave.
You might be able to run SwiftWebUI within an iOS app.


## SwiftWebUI Hello World

To setup a SwiftWebUI project,
create a "macOS tool project" in Xcode 11,
then use the new SwiftPM integration and add
`https://github.com/SwiftWebUI/SwiftWebUI`
as a dependency.

Open the `main.swift` file and replace it's content
with:
```swift
import SwiftWebUI

SwiftWebUI.serve(Text("Holy Cow!"))
```

Compile and run the app in Xcode, open Safari and hit
[`http://localhost:1337/`](http://localhost:1337/):

## ü•ëüçû AvocadoToast

A small SwiftWebUI sample  based on the 
[SwiftUI Essentials](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/216)
"Avocado Toast App".
